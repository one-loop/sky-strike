### Sky Strike

This is a 2D top-down airplane shooter where you control a plane and aim to avoid enemies flying and shooting at you. This game was developed for the final project of CS-1001 @ NYUAD and received 100%.

Controls: WASD/UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT to move your plane, and SPACE to shoot

Overview
●	In our game, you control a plane, and enemy planes are flying toward you trying to shoot at you. You have to avoid colliding with them or getting hit by their bullets or your health will go down.
●	You can control your plane with the arrow keys or the WASD keys and shoot with the space key
●	As the game progresses, random health packs will spawn and float down. If you collect one, your health will be restored. If you run out of health, the game is over and the user will have the option to restart the game.
●	If you shoot an enemy plane, your score increases by one. Your objective is to survive as long as possible and get as high of a score as possible.
●	Enemy planes spawn randomly, and the rate at which they fire bullets is also randomly set. 
●	The player can set the difficulty in the start menu (higher difficulty means more enemy planes are spawned, bullets do more damage and it is harder to aim at the planes.
●	We plan to store the highest score achieved in a separate file so that every time a player plays the game, they can attempt to beat the high score
●	We also plan to make the game engaging with the help of a tile map, to create a custom-level background, explosion animations, UI sounds, and background music
